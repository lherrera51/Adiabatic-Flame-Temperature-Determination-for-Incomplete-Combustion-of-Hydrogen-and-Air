In this project, I present a methodology for determining the adiabatic flame temperature of a chemical reaction through the solution of a system of equation, which are derived from atom balancing and equilibrium constants. The approach utilizes the NASA polynomial form for enthalpy and involves solving a set of equations to find the composition of products at different temperatures. The accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm are demonstrated for a chemical system comprising three equations, representing a simplified scenario. The algorithm successfully determines the adiabatic flame temperature for this smaller system. 

However, as the chemical system expands to include nine equations, representing a more complex reaction mechanism, the computational time required for solving the system increases significantly.
